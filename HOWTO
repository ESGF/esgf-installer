Hello, 

The following describes how to get started with installing the ESG
Data Node.  The installation scripts may be in flux, as we
continuously improve the process. Please provide us with your input
regarding your installation experience.


The update script can be fetched from our website at:
http://rainbow.llnl.gov/dist/esgf-installer/esg-update

Follow the instructions below describing how to run the update script.
       
The update and install scripts is written in bash and is intended to
be run on CentOS/RedHat Linux distributions as *root* or a root
effective user via "sudo -s" (IMPORTANT: Do not run scripts directly
with sudo.  Straight sudo filters out needed environment variables!).  

I suggest taking all the defaults presented and reading and following
the script's suggestions.

To help manage your expectations of the installation process, the
following should give you a ballpark idea:

The entire process takes approximately, a bit under, an hour.  There
are about a 20 prompts for user input - almost all of which have
resonable defaults (you can just hit enter - recommended).  The lion's
share of the time is spent building the various tools and executibles
(heads up: globus and python take a relatively long time to build :-\).
We have worked hard to make the installation of the Data Node rather
painless.

Thank you for your participation!


*************
Instructions:
*************
- Before you do any installation REGISTER (get an account) at the
gateway you intend to connect to:
        (ESG-PCMDI) http://pcmdi3.llnl.gov/esgcet/
- Be sure the machine you are installing on is a CentOS/Redhat linux
family distribution.
- Be sure the machine has a fully qualified hostname and responds to
hostname -s, hostname --domain and hostname --fqdn.
- The machine must have all development headers installed.
- The installation user must have root (or sudo) privileges.


0) We HIGHLY recommend creating a separate installation user account (Ex:
   esg-user) and give that user the ability to use sudo (i.e. create
   an appropriate entry in /etc/sudoers). If not there maybe
   undesirable results.  Ex: All of root's cronjobs getting nuked.  In
   general it is a good idea to use the operating system mechanisms to
   help sequester an installation such as this.


1) LOGIN as the installation user


2) From the installation user become root or root equiv....
   
   % sudo -s  
   
   (do not run the script directly from sudo because sudo filters env vars)


3) Download the "update" script to /usr/local/bin on the target machine
   % cd /usr/local/bin
   % wget -O esg-update http://198.128.245.140/dist/esgf-installer/esg-update


4) MAKE SURE YOU MANUALLY CHECK THE MD5 CHECKSUM!
   (We don't want to run just any ol' script as root!!! :-)

   % diff <(md5sum esg-update | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 1) <(curl -s http://198.128.245.140/dist/esgf-installer/esg-update.md5 | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 1)
   
   (there should be NO difference! i.e. the command returns you back to your prompt)

   Besides the manual check the script is "self verifying".
   If the script has been tampered with in any way, it will indicate
   this and NOT RUN. At which point you must fetch the file from the
   distribution site again. - step 3


5) % chmod 555 esg-update

   You only need to run esg-update initially to get the supporting
   install scripts.  You may also run it in the future to subsequently
   to get the latest revisions of install scripts.
   

6) Fetch the latest node installation script 
   
   (MD5 verification is done within the scripts from now on, so make
   sure it always says "[VERIFIED]" after a file is fetched)
   
   % esg-update node

7) Run the installation script (read prompts and instructions carefully...)
   
   Note on prompts...
        [y/N] means "N" is the default, you may just hit return
        Default values appear in "[]" brackets, hitting return uses them.

   % esg-node --set-type data
   % esg-node --install --verify

   With the --verify flag verification tests are run throughout the
   installation procedure.  Also the last verification step of the
   installation will perform a test publish to the chosen gateway
   (default: ESG-PCMDI)

   After the initial installation you may subsequently perform test
   publications independently by using the --test-pub flag.

   % esg-node --test-pub

8) Join the appropriate mailing list...

Errant key strokes are picked up, so please be careful.

As mentioned the script is in bash, so if you are so inclined, feel
free to read it! However, do not modify the script, that would void
the support contract :-).

Enjoy!
