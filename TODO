   Description: 
   A running list of items of work that need to be done

***************************************************************************

TODO:

overall:
-set new header for all files
-untabify all files (use only spaces)
-Put in MORE JUnit testing.
-Write test cases for codebase.
-Install BDM client and simple sanity check call(s)
-Build Shell

core:
Metrics & Monitoring
 ->Put in Query "LIMIT" clause at the end of each query to a configurable value
 ->For Monitoring put in time series results in fixed size LRU cache
-Remove faux 'gateway' from codebase.
-Put in XML Parsing of Payload message data (the catalog)
 ->Test xjc ant task and building stubs
 -> Have to get or make catalog specific XSD to JAXB on.

-Find out from Bob what the deal is/was with hessian to see if I can
safely upgrade to using 3.1.5 - he alluded to hacking the hessian code
on the python side for things to work... will an upgraded hessian
screw things up?

      hessian-3.0.20.jar ->? hessian-3.1.5.jar

-Install and setup database version control like LiquiBase, for DNM managed tables

DONE:
xClean up InstallCert Blurting out exception stack trace simply because
 you don't have the key.  (that's the point - you're trying to get it :-)

esg-node:
xInspect the "dedup" function to work with install_log as well
xPut in better software version string checking in check_version()
xGIT - put in fix to update an existing git fetching for cdat upgraded versions


libs: (todo's and issues)
xWhen cut over to ivy make sure to get rid of [jsr173] api jar since the
xtansient dependency [stax] api jar is fetched.  Also the [jaxb1-impl.jar]
xmay be removed since ivy pulls down the transient dependency
[jaxb-impl.jar] that replaces it.

	git rm jsr173 api use fetched stax api
	git rm jaxb1-impl use fetched jaxb-impl

xRoll back log4j from 1.2.15 to 1.2.14 to avoid ivy repo fetch failure
issue.

	git rm log4j-1.2.15.jar use fetched log4j-1.2.14.jar


xFix issue with ivy having problems with resolving "javamail" to fetch
 mailapi.jar and smtp.jar

-Keep only:
       ivy-2.1.0.jar
       [hessian-3.0.20.jar] ? Test that still wire compatible with python version.
 x     [javamail = mail.jar, smtp.jar] ? working on resoving ivy repo failure
       (everything else we fetch via ivy)

(jars that will be fetched by ivy that can be removed)

    activation.jar
    commons-dbcp-1.2.2.jar
    commons-dbutils-1.3.jar
    commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
    commons-pool-1.5.4.jar
    jaxb-api.jar
    jaxb-impl.jar
    jaxb-xjc.jar
    jaxb1-impl.jar
    jsr173_1.0_api.jar
    junit-4.8.2.jar
    log4j-1.2.15.jar
    postgresql-8.3-603.jdbc3.jar
    servlet-api.jar
