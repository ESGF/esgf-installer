The goal of this script is to automate as many tasks as possible
 regarding the installation, maintenance and use of the ESGF
 software stack that is know as the \"ESGF Node\".  A software
 stack is a collection of tools that work in concert to perform a
 particular task or set of tasks that are semantically united. The
 software stack is comprised of: Tomcat, Thredds, CDAT & CDMS,
 PostgreSQL, MyProxy, and several ESGF.org custom software
 applications running on a LINUX (RedHat/CentOS) operating system.
 Through the installation process there are different accounts
 that are created that facilitate the communication between the
 software stack entities.  These credentials are internal to the
 stack.  It is recommended that you use the defaults provided
 throughout this installation.  The security impact with regards
 to the visibility and accessibility of the constituent components
 of the stack depends on other factors to be addressed by your
 organization.

 Please be sure that you have gotten your created an account on
 your ESGF IDP Peer.
